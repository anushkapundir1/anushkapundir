## Hi, I'm Anushka 👋

I am an aspiring **AI / GenAI Practitioner** with a strong interest in building **practical, real-world AI applications** using Python and Large Language Models.

I focus on understanding how AI systems work end-to-end — from data handling and embeddings to LLM integration and application logic.



### 🧠 Areas of Interest
- Generative AI & Large Language Models (LLMs)
- AI Agents and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Applied Machine Learning (foundations)



### 🛠️ Technical Skills
- **Languages:** Python, SQL
- **AI / GenAI:** LangChain, Prompt Engineering, LLM APIs  
- **Concepts:** RAG, Embeddings, Vector Search  
- **Backend:** Django, Basic Flask  
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub
